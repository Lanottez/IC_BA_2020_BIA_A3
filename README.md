Q2:  What happened when the price was increased?
                                                     
How affected: - membership type
              - social class  
              - gender  
              - age 


Qian:
* What happened when the price was increased, revenue plot over time
* Any trend in visitation during last months before gym : - peak times
                                                        - freq per month
 
Mary: 
* Churn rate over time
* Membership over time??
* Membership change per club  // clubs number plot

Hey guys i'm still learning my way to use pandas but here is some finding i found use other software. It shall be a good benchmark for double check and ideas. 
Currently i'm doing most analysis in excel & powerbi and moved/will move to jupyter if find any useful insights.

Findings - benchmark and won't include in jupyter
Average duration of membership is around 4.5 month for standard, and 2 month for flexible.
There is no significant membership duration differnece between - Affluence (range 2.3-1.97 for flexible; 5-3.8 for standard)
                                                               - different clubs (range 2.5-2 for flexible;  5.3- 4.1 for standard)
                                                               - ages (seperated by age group- range 2.6-1.9 for flexible ; 5.7-4 for standard)
                                                               - Gender (2.3-2.2 for flexible; 4.8 - 4.5 for standard)
                                                               
Interesting insights - Will/has move to pandas by tomorrow:
                                                       - for people left membership- there is no change in AFFLUENCE over year
                                                       - for people still in memebership - there is trend by affluence, gender membership status amond different years. However there is no change if we filter the data by memebership status >12 month.
                                                       - younger people are more willing to join club in recent year. we can target promotion here 
                                                       
                                                       - In general we see a reduction in number of memebers that left gym in 2016 compare wil 2015, and increase in numbers of members that join gym in 2016 compare with 2015. This might due to new gym opening - further investigation required
