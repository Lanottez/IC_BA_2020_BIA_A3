Case Questions
2. What happened when the price was increased
Churn increase, how the revenue affected include those plots and include the analysis in Appendix
How the price increase afffect different segments 

1. How could they improve their pricing strategy
Mention the duration of different segments and discuss if there is a specific target group
Different pricing for different clubs or different segments e.g. students/retiree etc

3. What does this suggest as possible options going forward
Except for adjustment in pricing maybe adaprt a new model , combining specialised services on a budget to reduce churn etc?
Maybe some clubs are not so profitable??

4. In additional to price, what other factors influence whether a member is going to leave
Gym environment (Visitins hours - peak times etc)? age of the club? 

5. Bonus: Given this, to what degree can we predict individual n-pea

## Report Structure (based on guidelines)

### Title pagr

### Summary

###Introduction

An overview of the context for the analysis, including a clear statement of the business problem -> plot the revenue over time and state the not so big growth 
Clear statement of your hypotheses and predictions
* churn has played a big role in the phenomenon of not high enough revenue growth, plot churn over time
* churn affected differently different customers segments
A brief overview of the approach used in your analysis. -> Identify our customers profile, how the price increase affect the different segments and what trategies should we follow

### Technologies and techniques ???
An exact process description used in the analysis
Sufficient detail of the data analysis for someone to replicate the results (this should
be automatic in Jupyter Notebook).

###Results
A presentation and summary of the data using means, histograms and other descriptive statistics
Figures, tables and graphs, insofar as they help to enhance the clarity of the  information (include captions)
An explanation of any figures, tables or graphs

### Discussion
A short paragraph summarising the overall trend of the findings
A clear statement of whether your hypothesis is correct (include caveats where necessary) -> indeed the chur was incresed on 2016, affected differently tdifferent segments refert to those
An explanation of any errors
A discussion of the strengths and limitations of the analysis. -> e.g on question 5, or on further segmentation, as well as statistical analysis e.g regression etc
