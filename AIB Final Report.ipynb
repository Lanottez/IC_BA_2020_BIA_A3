    "### Summary\n",
    "The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of OC&Gym's performance from 2009 to 2018, review the impact of the price increase in 2016, and offer our recommendations regarding the pricing strategy of OC&Gym and further suggestions that would improve the business' current performance. This report will pay particular attention to the impact of the price adjustment on the different customer segments. The key procedure used includes performing exploratory analysis of the subscriptions and visitations dataset provided by OC&Gym. Public information sources, including public research reports, are used as an additional source of information to evaluate the UK gym industry's current climate. The data analysis results showed that the customer churn rate increased after the price adjustment; however, it remains well below the industry average. In particular, members from lower affluence classes and those in their 20's has the higher churn rates thus is more sensitive to the membership price increase. In addition, there seems to be a seasonal trend in membership cancellations with more members leaving during the winter; however, this requires further investigation with more robust individual member data to identify the key reasons behind the trend. The reports find that although the revenue increased after the price adjustment, the corresponding increase in churn rates in price-sensitive member groups would ultimately cancel the revenue boost. Remedial action in OC&Gym's pricing strategy is required to ensure the business is hitting it's key KPI, including revenue per member and churn rates."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the fitness industry in the United Kingdom has been growing rapidly.In 2019, the fitness penetration rate has grown to 15.6%; in the other word, 1 in every 7 people is a member of a gym (Scheerder, J., Vehams H., Helsen K,,2020). Over the 12 month period to the end of March 2019, fitness facilities increased by 2.9%, from 7038 to 7239, the total number of members increased by 4.7% to 10.4 million, and the market value increased 4.2% to Â£5.1 billion. However, the growth of new fitness facilities has been slowing down, as 215 new fitness facilities opened in the last 12 months, down from 275 in 2018(Sports Thinktank,2019]. While the overall fitness industry is growing, the competition has become more intense. Therefore, the operator of the fitness enterprise should pay close attention to customer churn rate, pricing strategy and marketing strategy to maintain the growth of its revenue, and use modern data science and technology to guide any business decision, otherwise the enterprise is in the risk of falling behind competitors. Our client is the operator ofOC&Gym, a budget gym. The gym has been operating well over the past 10 years and expanded to every borough in London, but the expansion began to slow recently. While the operator decided to increase the price for both standard and flexible memberships to maintain the growth, the increase of revenue is not as much as they would have hoped.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report aims to help our client to make smarter business decisions by analyzing the subscription and visitation of members. There are a few key fields to which this report addresses. First, by analyzing the overall growth of revenue and churn rate, our client could compare the performance ofOC&Gym to the average performance in the whole industry. Second, we aim to provide a better pricing strategy to our client, as we believe the current pricing strategy of our clients is flawed since charges the same fees for clubs in different regions of London and in different seasons. Therefore, we want to help our client to make a more flexible pricing strategy, including seasonal discount or off-peak discount, that could help them to attract more members and consequently increase its revenues. We are looking to analyze the factors that might influence whether a member is going to leave by analyzing the churn rate of different groups by identifying the customers profile. While given such limited data we are unable to provide a very detailed insight about the factors that are driving the members away, we are looking to spot any incidents that are worth further exploration. Third, we will analyze how the price increase in 2016 affected the different segments to help our client to understand why the increased revenue is lower than supposed. Fourth, we will apply machine learning technology to predict the duration of membership of a new customer that could provide more insight to help our client to make business decisions for the future."

    "### 2.Technologies and techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "The data analysis section of this report is done by using pandas and numpy in python, and the representation of charts is done by using matplotlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of our analysis is to calculate and visualize the yearly and monthly data of active members and the corresponding growth rates. The purpose of this step is to provide a general picture of how OC&Gym has been growing in term of new members, and to visualize that how the price increasing in 2016 affected the growth of new members. For this part of code, please refer to the section 1: Membership and Revenue in the appendix.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The second part of is to visualize the yearly and monthly data of revenue, and the corresponding growth rates. Like the first step, this step is to provide a general picture of how OC&Gym has been growing in term of new revenues, and to visualize that how the price increasing in 2016 affect the growth of revenue. We are also comparing the result from this part and last part to the average performance of the fitness industry to evaluate the performance of OC& Gym in general. For this part of code, please refer to section 1: Membership and Revenue in the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third part is to evaluate the churn rate, since we believe that this unsatisfied revenue growth rate is due to high customer churn rate caused by membership fee increase, as there is no big change in fitness industry in recent years, therefore analysis on churn rate is critical, as we are looking to understand that why the revenue increase is not as high as supposed. For this part of code, please refer to section 2.3 Churn per population segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth part is to analyze the membership by segmentation. This part is the core of our analysis. Since this will not only help us to understand what happens to churn rate when price has increased, but also to find any possible strategy to smooth the churn rate side effect during price increasing period. By looking at churn rate in different affluence we can see that members in which class are most sensitive or robust to price increase. Moreover, if we look at churn rate of different age-groups we can see that people in which age are more sensitive to price. This gives us room for price discrimination by segmentation. We could provide special offers and promotion to those prices sensitive group to attract them to join membership. For this part of code, please refer to section 3. Membership by segmentation and section 4. Duration analysis Graph by year\n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth part is to analyze how seasonality affects the members. We use function to plot the visitation of all members in different seasons. The goal is to find that whether the cancelation rate is abnormally high in a particular season, during which we could offer discount or promotion to keep the customers. By doing this, we are trying to find regular market patterns and generate beneficial strategies from the opportunities inside to reduce our churn rate. For this part of code, please refer to section 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sixth part is to a general profile of our customer. This part provides a general description about the demographics of all customers. In this part, we measure the numbers of active members and separate them into different group by different segment such as age, gender, affluence etc. By doing this, we are aiming to find different patterns among people with different traits to determine our target groups that are suitable for further pricing strategies. For this part of code, please refer to section 6. Customer Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "The seventh part is to use Machine model to predict the duration of customers. We applied k-nearest neighbors model, a machine learning method used for classification and regression, to predict the exact duration of any new members. The inputs to KNN are all the characteristics of a customer that could be allocated from the dataset provided by our client, including club, join date, affluence, gender, type of membership, and the year of birth. While most factors of customer are categorical, all of them are normalized to digits so the KNN model could read them. The output from KNN model is the exact months of duration. For this part of code, please refer to the section 7. k-Nearest Neighbor Model.\n"

    "#### Suggestions\n",
    "OC&Gym's fitness total revenue has grown in popularity since it's open, rapidly grown from 0.1 million in 2009 to 2.1million in 2018. Whereas from 2017 to 2017, the fitness and health club industry revenue in Europe has only increased by 0.4% (Scheerder J.2020). OC&Gym's rate of growth has been faster than UK fitness industry in general. However, according to ahead mentioned insights, the revenue increasing rate in recent years is less than expected. While the operator decided to increase the membership price and has a vast new club expansion to further increase revenue in 2016, the total revenue improvement is not as what's expected. As mentioned above, this is primarily due to an increase in the churn rate. Although the membership price has increased, it also leads to a corresponding group of people left membership, which can cancel out the increase in revenue caused by price adjustment. Hence we carefully analysed the membership fee increase influence in 2016, and further analysed customer behaviour to identify the potential strategy that can further improve revenue, and in below is what we suggested:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, improve current pricing strategy according to different member's affluence type and age. According to our analysis of membership fee increase impact in 2016, we found that members from lower class (C2&DE) are susceptible to price judgement, whereas high&middle class members are relatively more robust to any price increase. Also, members from 24 to 30 are more susceptible to price change. Hence when doing an advertisement to attract new customers, we could give promotions, discounts, or special offers to low social class membersâfor instance, providing a one-month free membership to existing customers that come from lower affluence class, if they can successfully invite their friend to join membership freely for the first month. Moreover, according to our analysis on customer pool constitution ratio, our current members predominately come from high&middle social class or aging from 30 to 40. It means that majority of our customer are inelastic to price increase, which gives us room to increase membership fee without losing numerous existing members. This can be achieved according to a proper pricing strategy: combining price increases with relevant special offers. One applicable method is that during membership fee increase, hand special offers to price elastic existing customers group to reduce their incentive to leave membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, increasing total revenue by reducing customer churn rate. The primary reason why membership price increase in 2016 doesn't lead to the expected increase in total revenue is that the churn rate increased corresponding. Hence understand influencer of churn rate and implement an appropriate strategy to reduce churn is critical. Depicts price increase, seasonality also plays a significant role in influencing churn rate. In the result session, we could see that winter is the period that has the highest membership cancellation, which is congruous with less number of visiting. This suggests that our customers lack interest in coming to the gym during winter and withdraw from the membership. Hence further strategy implementation is required to boosts up incentive to exercise during the winter period. One suggestion is to conduct group exercise. A recent study from Penn State University states that group exercise leads to higher customer retention rate in the gym. It examined a group of 25 adults with mixed-gender who did not exercise regularly and traced them to complete a 30-week group exercise program. At the end of the program, all subjects completed most of the class they signed up for with a completion rate of 98.8% (Les M.,2016)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this study also suggests that intensity and regularity of workout should gradually increase in order to achieve the best retention rate. As a result, ensuring group fitness class is offered in the club with regularly updating content is an excellent way to maintain a high retention rate. Suggested group fitness class includes cardiovascular, strength and flexibility training and other specialised studio exercise such as boxing and yoga. This is because according to the study (Spiers A. 2016), specialty studio has a high growth rate (around 74%), compared with traditional fitness clubs during the same period (only at 5%). This paper also states that people are more willing to pay a higher price for the specialised training session, which gives more reasons and tolerance for OC&Gym's further price increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, OC&Gym should adjust its marketing strategy to attract more loyal customers and identify and retain unstable customers before they leave. In result session, we could see that female, flexible subscriber and people from lower affluence types tend to have a lower membership duration and higher churn rate than other groups. Further analysis is recommended to understand the fundamental reasoning of those groups' higher churn rate; relative data such as customer satisfaction survey and membership withdraw reasoning is required to conduct further analysis. At the current stage, the marketing group should put less focus on the non-loyal customer groups. OC&Gym should modify their customer-acquisition incentives of the sale team - reward sale teams and marketing channels to acquire loyal customer groups that stay longer. Besides, except average duration difference between different segmentation, there is also evidence that loyal members tend to leave membership at a certain period, once around eight months after they join the membership and the other is around 23 months. Further analysis is required to understand the reasoning behind. At present, considering giving special reward to customers that stay above nine months and 24 months to help customer stick. Lastly, we could also use generated KNN model to identify an unstable customer. The KNN model provides a technique to predict the potential membership duration of the customer, which could in use to retain customers before they leave. For example, give them a special offer to join group exercise around their predicted membership period. The KNN model can also predict potential membership duration even before the customer join according to their segmentation (gender, class, age, etc.). This increases the OC&Gym's ability to implement flexible price strategy and enhance price discrimination ability.\n",
