    "### Summary\n",
    "    The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of OG&Gym’s performance over the ten years with comparison to its competitors, to review the impact of the price increase in 2016, and to offer suggestion about the pricing strategy. The source of information includes the public information, including news, public research report, etc, and private dataset provided by our client, including user subscriptions data and visitation data from 2009 to 2019. By applying various data techniques to find any insightful pattern about the churn rate of customer, this report examines the reason that why the increasing price in 2016 did not result in growth of revenue that is high as the operator supposed. Consequently, this report provides various suggestion to the operator of OG&Gym that could help them to maintain the growth of revenue, including to improve current pricing strategy based on the affluence type and age, to increase total revenue by reducing customer churn rate, and to adjust its marketing strategy to attract more loyal customers and identify and retain unstable customers before they leave.\n"

    "### Introduction\n",
    "    In recent years, the fitness industry in the United Kingdom has been growing rapidly. In 2019, the fitness penetration rate has grown to 15.6%; in the other word, 1 in every 7 people is a member of a gym[ref]. Over the 12 month period to the end of March 2019, fitness facilities increased by 2.9%, from 7038 to 7239, the total number of members increased by 4.7% to 10.4 million, and the market value increased 4.2% to £5.1 billion. However, the growth of new fitness facilities has been slowing down, as 215 new fitness facilities opened in the last 12 months, down from 275 in 2018[ref]. While the overall fitness industry is growing, the competition has become more intense. Therefore, the operator of the fitness enterprise should pay close attention to customer churn rate, pricing strategy and marketing strategy to maintain the growth of its revenue, and use modern data science and technology to guide any business decision, otherwise the enterprise is in the risk of falling behind competitors. Our client is the operator of OG&Gym, a budget gym. The gym has been operating well over the past 10 years and expanded to every borough in London, but the expansion began to slow recently. While the operator decided to increase the price for both standard and flexible memberships to maintain the growth, the increase of revenue is not as much as they would have hoped.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This report aims to help our client to make smarter business decisions by analyzing the subscription and visitation of members. There are a few key fields to which this report addresses. First, by analyzing the overall growth of revenue and churn rate, our client could compare the performance of OG&Gym to the average performance in the whole industry. Second, we aim to provide a better pricing strategy to our client, as we believe the current pricing strategy of our clients is flawed since charges the same fees for clubs in different regions of London and in different seasons. Therefore, we want to help our client to make a more flexible pricing strategy, including seasonal discount or off-peak discount, that could help them to attract more members and consequently increase its revenues. We are looking to analyze the factors that might influence whether a member is going to leave by analyzing the churn rate of different groups by identifying the customers profile. While given such limited data we are unable to provide a very detailed insight about the factors that are driving the members away, we are looking to spot any incidents that are worth further exploration. Third, we will analyze how the price increase in 2016 affected the different segments to help our client to understand why the increased revenue is lower than supposed.  Fourth, we will apply machine learning technology to predict the duration of membership of a new customer that could provide more insight to help our client to make business decisions for the future.

    "### Technologies and techniques\n",
    "    The data analysis section of this report is done by using pandas and numpy in python,and the representation of charts is done by using matplotlib. The first procedure of analysis is to import all the data from the dataset provided by our clients and eliminate any rows that have detect whether is any lost values in the dataset and remove those rows if they exist. Then, we implemented multiple data technique to scrutinis information behind the dataset using data analysis tools\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Firs, we calculated the duration of each member based on the subscription by subtract the date they left the gym by the date they joined the gym. . The For those customer who purchased\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lastly, to better understand the churn rate of member of OG&Gym, the report applies k-nearest neighbors algorithm, a machine learning method used for classification and regression, to predict the exact duration of any new members. The inputs to KNN are all the characterists of a customer that could be allocated from the dataset provided by our client, including club, join date, affluence, gender, type of membership, and the year of birth. While most factors of customer are categorical, all of them are normalised to digits so the KNN model could read them. The output from KNN model is the exact months of duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To verify the accuracy of the KNN model, the dataset are randomly divided into two parts: trainning data and validation data. Trainning data are used to train the KNN model, and validation data are used to verify the accuracy of the KNN model. Since the time complexity of KNN model is large, only partial of the dataset are used to train the KNN model. Also, since KNN model requires the determination of the value of K, a range of possible values of K are passed to the KNN model to find the optimum value of K that could return the lowest classification rate."
